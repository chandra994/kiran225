problem statement:The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes
modeling past credit card transactions with the
knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. This
model is then used to identify whether a new transaction
is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the
fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect
fraud classifications.
